# Python Pathfinder
### pathfinding algorithms tested to use with RoboRTS

## The Graph Implementation
pathfinder.types.graph is implemented to
- be fast with the use of referencing.
- be able to be generated from ...
- be able to be generated from arena pixel art.
- be able to be forgot after nodes are picked.

Graphs are generated from special strings and the format's credits go to Boraini.
The graph implementation can be used for any project, but crediting Boraini will be appreciated.

## Assortment of algorithms
Almost the entirety of the algorithm list is compiled from the algorithms in [Pathfinding.js](https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js/).
